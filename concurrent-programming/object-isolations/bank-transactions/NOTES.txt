* This example explains the difference between global and object-based isolations.
* Object-based isolations isolate (lock) the object we are processing only. Meanwhile, global isolations only let one thread execute a block of code (inside a critical section) at a  time.
* In fact, this works similar to read-write-locks, read locks allow multiple accesses from multiple threads; write locks allow only one thread to run (all others have to wait for the exection to be finished).
