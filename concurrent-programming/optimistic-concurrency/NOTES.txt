* GOOD EXPLANATION:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control

The optimistic concurrency pattern, which can be used to improve the performance of concurrent data structures.
There should be no locks, isolations or actors in optimistic concurrency.

* KEY POINTS:
- Optimistic concurrency means: check if the value has been changed, if it is NOT, do the UPDATE OPERATION, else continue inside an infinite loop until find a value that has not been changed.
- Always think about COMPARE_AND_SET(). This method is the keypoint of optimistic concurrency.
