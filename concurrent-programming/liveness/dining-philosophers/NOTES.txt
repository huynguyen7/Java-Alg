* We have five philosophers sitting around a roundtable. Let's say they're A, B, C, D, E. And there are exactly 5 chopsticks placed between them.
And so to eat, a philosopher needs to pick up its left and right chopstick and eat. And in fact, what philosophers do is they spend a lot of time thinking.

* TABLE with 5 people and 5 chopsticks:
      .___.
    ./ \ / \.
    |__   __|
    |       |
    .\._|_./
